a small tavern with two goblins and a shopkeeper
a dense maze filled with three ogres guarding treasure
an open field with a pond and scattered goblin raiders
a underground dungeon with locked doors and hidden chests
a haunted graveyard with restless spirits and ancient tombs
a bustling marketplace with multiple shops and wandering customers
a dark forest clearing with wolves and a mysterious hermit's hut
a abandoned castle courtyard with crumbling walls and goblin squatters
a flooded cavern system with islands connected by narrow bridges
a desert oasis with palm trees, water, and nomad merchants
